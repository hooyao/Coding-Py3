# Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
#
# Note:
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: root = [3,1,4,None,2], k = 1
#    3
#   / \
#  1   4
#   \
#    2
# Output: 1
# Example 2:
#
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,None,None,1], k = 3
#        5
#       / \
#      3   6
#     / \
#    2   4
#   /
#  1
# Output: 3
# Follow up:
# What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
#
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
#
# Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
#
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
#
#
# Note:
#
# All of the nodes' values will be unique.
# p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
